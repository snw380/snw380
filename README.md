### Hello! Welcome to my Github portfolio. 👋

<!--  This is a top secret incrypted message  🤫 -->

I'm a young dev from Florida, a visual person that loves the landscape of front end but also enjoys the challanges that back end can present. 
- I'm currently studying at UCF 📚
- proficient in `CSS`, `HTML`, `JavaScript`, & `MySQL` 💻
- constantly expanding my skills, currently learning `React` & PWA's

At the age of 18 I moved across the country to attend the Bethel School of Ministry. This established some core values in my life that I live by. They are, 
- God is good 
- salvation creates joyful identity 
- creating healthy family 
- free and responsible 
- honor affirms value 
- generous like my father
